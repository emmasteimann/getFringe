Fringe Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
I made my original comic downloader for Scary Go Round, but then I wondered if I could expand it to my other favorite comics, I've now expanded it to [Fringe](http://fringe.wikia.com/wiki/Comics).

Each chapter is created every issue and loaded into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).

How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for Fringe.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby getFringe.rb`
  - Enjoy all of Fringe!

What this does....
-----------

This downloads the entirety of Fringe Comic Volume 1 from scans done on [Fringe Wikia](http://fringe.wikia.com/). The original was release at 2008's Comic con.
